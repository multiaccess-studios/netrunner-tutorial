    <p>
        <em>Reading Time: 30 minutes.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome! If you're reading this, you should already have a copy of the
        Netrunner system gateway starter decks! Whoever is introducing you to
        Netrunner should have given you these: if they haven't go and bother
        them about it now.
    </p>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
        In Netrunner, one player will take on the role of a corporation, who is
        attempting to accomplish goals in the name of profit and futhering their
        capitalistic goals. Meanwhile, the other player will be the runner: a
        renegade hacker attempting to break into the corporations servers and
        steal their secrets for fun and profit.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Tutorial Corporation</th>
            <th>Tutorial Runner</th>

    <p>
        Most of the time, each players identity will be critical to their
        playstyle, and will tell you a lot about how the game is likely to play.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the tutorial game, your identities are blank cards and so wont have
        this kind of impact&mdash;after all you don't know which play style
        you'll enjoy yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tutorial is going to take you through every single card in the
        starter decks. It's a good idea to look at and understand them as best
        as you can while you read this article. If you want a closer look, you
        can click on a card to see a larger view of it.
    </p>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>
        Each player will start the game with 5 cards and 5 credits, and may
        choose to mulligan their starting hand once, shuffling their entire hand
        back into their deck and drawing a fresh hand of 5 cards. The corp goes
        first.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three primary resources in netrunner, clicks (<img src="click.svg">),
        credits (<img src="credit.svg">), and cards. Clicks are action points,
        on their turns the runner will gain <img src="click.svg"><img src="click.svg"><img src="click.svg"><img src="click.svg">
        and the corp will gain <img src="click.svg"><img src="click.svg"><img src="click.svg">.
        Credits are a general purpose resource used to pay for many things in
        netrunner. The following basic actions are available at all times:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><img src="click.svg">: Draw one card from your deck.</li>
        <li><img src="click.svg">: Gain 1 credit.</li>
        <li><img src="click.svg">: Install a card from your hand.</li>
        <li><img src="click.svg">: Play a card from your hand.</li>
        <li><img src="click.svg">: Run any server. (runner only)</li>
        <li><img src="click.svg"> <img src="credit.svg">: Advance an installed card. (corp only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While the corp has one fewer <img src="click.svg"> than the runner, they
        must make a mandatory draw at the start of each of their turns which
        does not cost them a click. If the corps deck is empty when they are
        forced to draw for turn, they lose the game. The runner only draws cards
        when they take the basic action to draw a card, or use another card with
        a draw instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a card is installed it is placed into the play area, and will
        remain there until it is destroyed and sent to the discard pile. A large
        part of the asymmetry of Netrunner comes from the difference between how
        the corp and runner install cards. When the runner installs cards, they
        pay their cost and place them into the play area face up with no
        specific structure to where they are placed. When the corp installs
        cards they pay no cost (with some exceptions) and place them into the
        play area face down and organised into columns called servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a card is played it is placed into the play area, then its effect
        resolves, then it is moved into the discard pile.
    </p>
    <p>
        Running and advancing will be explained later in this tutorial.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of your turn, if you have more than 5 cards in hand, discard
        down to 5 cards.
    </p>
    <h2>Agendas</h2>
    <p>
        Agendas are the projects the corporation wants to complete (and
        "score"), and that the runner wants to "steal" information about and put
        a stop to.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Superconducting_Hub.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Offworld_Office.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Send_a_Message.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Each agenda has two main printed numbers both in the top half of the
        card overlapping its art box. The one in the top right is the
        "advancement requirement" of the agenda, the one in the bottom left is
        the "agenda point value" of the agenda.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order for the corporation to score the agenda, it must have a number
        of advancement counters on the card equal to or greater than the
        advancement requirement of the agenda. When the corp takes the basic
        action to advance a card, they may place one advancement counter on an
        agenda (or certain other cards with an ability that allows them to be
        advanced). Once an agenda has enough advancement counters on it, the
        corp may add it to their score during their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only installed cards can be advanced, and so in order to advance their 
        agendas the corporation will need to install them in the play area in a
        remote server. Each remote server (column of cards) can have at most one
        agenda in its root (the end of the column closest to the corp).
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the corp, the runner does not care about the advancement
        requirement of an agenda. In order to steal it, all they need to do is
        access it. To access an agenda, they must breach the server it is in.
        To breach the server, they must run it. This can be done with the basic
        run action, or through a number of cards that instruct the runner to
        run a server.
    </p>
    <p>
        When an agenda is scored or stolen, it moves into the respective players
        score area. Each agenda is worth its agenda point value while in a score
        area. A player wins when their score area has 6 points worth of agendas
        in it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ice</h2>
    <p>
        Ice are the corps primary tool to prevent the runner from breaching
        their servers. Ice can be installed protecting servers. Installing Ice
        costs 1<img src="credit.svg"> for each Ice already protecting the root
        of that server. Ice is always installed in the outermost position
        protecting a server, furthest from its root.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Barriers</th>
            <th>Code Gates</th>
            <th>Sentries</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Palisade.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Whitespace.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Tithe.png   "></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Bran_1.0.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Diviner.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Karuna.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Ice is installed rotated 90 degrees, which is why their art and their
        strength number (bottom left) are sideways in the above images.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like agendas, Ice have two printed numbers. One in the top left of the
        card, and the other in the bottom left rotated sideways. The number in
        the top left of the card is the Ices "rez cost", and the sideways number
        in the bottom left of the card is the Ices "strength".
    </p>
    <p>
        Like all corp cards, Ice is installed facedown and inactive. In order to
        use Ice to protect a server it must be rezzed.
    <p>
        During a run on a server, the runner will approach and then encounter
        each piece of Ice protecting the server root, from the outermost to the
        innermost Ice. When they approach unrezzed Ice, the corp may pay the
        printed rez cost to rez that Ice, turning it face up and activating it.
        Any rezzed Ice that is approached is encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary feature of Ice is subroutines. When the runner encounters
        Ice, the corporation may fire (use) the subroutines on that Ice in the
        order they are written.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll notice some of the subroutines on Ice do nasty things, like deal
        damage to the runner. When the runner takes damage, they must randomly
        discard a number of cards from their hand equal to the amount of damage
        taken. If they must discard more cards than are in their hand, they lose
        the game. Other subroutines give the corp a benefit, like gaining
        credits or allowing them to install extra Ice. By far the most
        common and impactful subroutine is the humble "End the run."
    </p>
    <p>
        Just three letters, with the power to put a stop to all of the runners
        grand plans of breaching the server, accessing the cards in the root,
        and stealing the agenda.
    </p>
    <h2>Icebreakers</h2>
    <p>
        Before subroutines fire, the runner has the opportunity to break them.
        Disabling them for the current encounter. This is done using a special
        type of program card called Icebreakers. All the programs in the starter
        deck are Icebreakers.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Fracter</th>
            <th>Decoder</th>
            <th>Killer</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Cleaver.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Unity.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Carmen.png"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>AI</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Mayfly.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        There are three numbers printed on programs. Two in the top left, and 
        one in the bottom left. The larger top left number printed in the circle
        is the programs install cost. The smaller number in the top left is the
        programs memory cost. The number in the bottom left is the programs
        strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to install a program, the runner must pay its install cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each runner identity has a memory limit. For The Catalyst this is 4.
        After installing a program if the total memory cost of all installed
        programs is greater than their identities memory limit, the runner must
        trash (discard) programs until the total memory cost of all installed
        programs is equal to or less than their identities memory limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ice and Icebreakers each have subtypes. Ice subtypes indicate the types
        of effects the Ice is likely to do, and certain Icebreaker subtypes are
        required to break each type of Ice.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Barriers end the run, and are broken by Fracters.</li>
        <li>Code Gates tax the runner, and are broken by Decoders.</li>
        <li>Sentries hurt the runner, and are broken by Killers.</li>
        <li>AI Icebreakers can break any Ice, but have downsides.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Icebreakers have "Interface" abilities printed on them. These abilities
        can only be used during an encounter, when the Ice being encountered
        has strength equal or less than the strength of the Icebreaker.
    </p>
    <p> 
        For this reason most Icebreakers have a paid ability that allows them to
        improve their own strength, and an interface paid ability that breaks
        some number of subroutines. At the end of each encounter, the strength
        of an Icebreaker resets to its printed strength, and broken subroutines
        are repaired. Breaking a subroutine and improving an Icebreakers
        strength are both temporary effects that end when an encounter ends.
    </p>
    <p>
        After passing an Ice, whether the subroutines were broken or not, the
        runner may choose to jack out: ending the run without risking an
        encounter with any futher Ice.
    </p>
    <h2>Run Example</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="corp.png"></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="corp.png" class="ice"></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Cleaver.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        In this example, the corp has a remote server with one unrezzed card in
        its root which might be an Agenda, with one unrezzed Ice protecting it.
        The runner has a cleaver installed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The runner uses the basic action to run any server, and chooses to run
        the server highlighted in this example. They aproach the outermost Ice
        protecting the server, in this case the single unrezzed Ice. The corp
        decides to pay three credits to rez the Ice.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="corp.png"></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Palisade.png" class="ice"></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Cleaver.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Because the palisade is protecting a remote server, it gains +2 strength
        from its static ability. This means it has four strength in total, which
        is more than the Cleavers three strength. The runner uses the cleavers
        second paid ability, spending 2 credits to increase the Cleavers
        strength by one. The cleaver now has four strength, which is equal to or
        greater than the Palisades four strength, and thus the runner can spend
        one more credit to use the Cleavers first paid ability, breaking up to
        two barrier subroutines. Palisade is a barrier, and so the runner
        targets the Palisades first (and only) subroutine: "End the run."
    </p>
    <p>
        Because all subroutines are broken, the corp has no subroutines to fire.
        The encounter ends, and the cleaver resets to three strength, and the
        subroutines on the palisade are no longer broken. The runner decides not
        to jack out, and instead approaches the root of the server. With no more
        defensive Ice, the run is declared successful, and the runner breaches
        the server: accessing all the cards inside.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Offworld_Office.png"></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Palisade.png" class="ice"></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Cleaver.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        The card was an offword office. Because this is an Agenda, the runner
        steals it, adding it to their score area and bringing them two points
        closer to winning the game!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Economy Cards (Events, Operations)</h2>
    <p>
        It costs the runner and the corporation credits to install programs and
        ice, rez ice, and break subroutines. The game would be very slow if the
        only supply of credits was from both players clicking for credits, and
        the five they each start with. Similarly, if each player has to click
        (or draw for turn in the case of the corp) to draw all their cards,
        it would take a long time to find the Agendas, Ice, and Icebreakers each
        player needs to win the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both players have access to cards with "play abilities". These cards are
        called Events for the runner and Operations for the corporation.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="float:left;">Runner Events</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th style="float:left;">Corp Operations</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Events and Operations have one printed number in the top left, this is
        their play cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both players can use the basic action to play a card from their hands,
        paying the printed play cost on a card, and resolving its effects before
        trashing the Event or Operation used.
    </p>
    <h2>Economy Cards (Resources, Assets)</h2>
    <p>
        Play abilities aren't the only way that players can maintain their
        economy, each side also has a type of installable card which can assist
        them with progressing through the game and paying for all of their
        costs.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="float:left;">Runner Resources</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Smartware_Distributor.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Telework_Contract.png"></td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Resources have their install cost printed in the top left. Assets have
        a rez cost printed in the top left, and a trash cost printed in the
        bottom right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Assets must be rezzed for their abilities to be used. It does not cost
        anything to install an asset. Assets are installed in the root of a
        server in the same fashion as Agendas. A server may only have one Asset
        OR one Agenda in its root.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the runner accesses an asset, they may pay its pritned trash cost to
        trash it: uninstalling it and sending it to the corporations discard
        pile.
    </p>
    <h2>Central Servers</h2>
    <p>
        You'll notice Red Team referrs to central servers. So far in this
        tutorial, we have only spoken about remote servers. In addition to any
        remote servers they have created to install their assets and agendas in,
        the corporation also has three central servers: Archives, HQ, and R&D.
        These servers can be defended by Ice just like remote servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Archives is the corporations discard pile. If they discard a card that
        the runner could not see then it is discarded face down. When the runner
        breaches archives, all the facedown cards within are revealed, and all
        agendas in archives are accessed and may be stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
        HQ is the runners hand, and is represented on the table by their
        Identity card. When a runner breaches HQ, they may access one card
        at random from the runners hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        R&D is the runners deck. If the runner breaches R&D, they may access the
        top card of the runners deck.
    </p>

    <h2>Run Events</h2>
    <p>
        Red Team is not the only card with an ability that instructs the runner
        to run a server. Run Events allow the Runner to make a run without using
        their basic action to run any server. These Events give additional
        upsides to the runner during or after that run.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Jailbreak.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Overclock.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Tread_Lightly.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        With Jailbreak, each card must be accessed separately. The runner must
        decide if they wish to pay the trash cost on the first card they access
        before looking at the second card. Cards accessed from R&D must be
        returned to the top of the deck in the same order they were in before
        the accesses occured.
    </p>
    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to programs, the runner has access to hardware cards. These
        typically provide passive benefits, and differ from programs in that
        they do not require memory units to install. In fact, they often grant
        the runner additional MU to work with.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Pennyshaver.png"></td>
            <td><img src="cards/Docklands_Pass.png"></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        The number in the top left is the install cost of a hardware card, and
        must be paid to install it.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that, you've now seen all of the cards in the runners starter deck.
        If you're curious how many of each are present, you can look at the very
        bottom of each card. The number of little white circles on the right
        hand side of the card footer (where the copyright notice is) is the
        number of each card present in the tutorial deck.
    </p>
    <h2>Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
        The corporation has one more type of card that can be installed in the
        root of servers, but unlike agendas and assets these cards are not
        limited to one per server, and can even be installed onto central
        servers!
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Manegarm_Skunkworks.png"></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        As with other corporation cards, the number in the top left is the cost
        to rez this asset. You must rez an upgrade for its effect to be active.
        In the case of manegarm skunkworks, you will want to rez it at the last
        possible moment: after the runner has declared they will not jack out,
        but before they approach the root of the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        When breaching a server, all upgrades are accessed in addition to any
        other cards accessed in the root of the server. The runner may choose
        the order that they access cards in the server root.
    </p>
    <h2>Ambush Assets</h2>
    <p>
        The corp has another kind of asset which is not economical in nature,
        these are called ambush assets. The tutorial deck includes one of these.
        It pretends to be an agenda, until the moment the runner decides they
        want to access it!
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Urtica_Cipher.png"></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        As with other corporation cards, the number in the top left is the cost
        to rez this asset. Not that you are ever likely to rez an Urtica Cipher
        and reveal its secret and murderous plans.
    </p>
    <h2>Seamless Launch</h2>
    <p>
        There is one last card to go in the corporation deck, and it's an
        important one.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="cards/Seamless_Launch.png"></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Seamless launch is an Event card that allows the corporation to put two
        advancement counters onto a card, for the cost of one click and one
        credit. Typically it takes two clicks and two credits for the same
        number of advances. This is critically important, as one of them can
        allow the corporation to score an Offworld Office without ever having
        to place advancement counters on it before the turn they score it.
        Similarly, two of them can be used together to score a Send a Message
        without ever advancing it. This strategy is called "Never Advance" and
        is useful as advancing an Agenda on the turn before you score it gives
        the runner an opportunity to run a server, knowing the card in it is
        either an Agenda or an Urtica Cipher.

    <h2>Full Timing Structure</h2>
    <p>
        The following is a full timing structure, that you can reference if you
        are confused about the order of events. Whoevers turn it is is
        considered to be the active player, and they may order their conditional
        abilities and use their paid abilities before the other player in each
        timing window where it is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW THIS. NOT KNOWING THE EXACT TIMINGS OF
            THINGS OCCURING WILL NOT BREAK THE GAME. ALL CARDS IN THE TUTORIAL
            ARE SIMPLE AND HAVE NO COMPLEX INTERACTIONS.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Any paid ability that has a cost which begins with "<img src="click.svg">"
        is considered an action, and may only be used at the point in the timing
        when sides are instructed to take an action.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following is a simplified overview, reviewing all elements of timing
        that cannot come up in the starter deck tutorial game.
